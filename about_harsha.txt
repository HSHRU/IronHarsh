Hi, My name is Sreeharsha Hanumanthu., my friends call me Harsha., 

I would like to tell one fun fact about me..,

I am always tendency of forgetting things. Most of the times the most 
important ones. But luck is in my side I never went into trouble. 
May be you are thinking where is the fun in it, that is probably in my
Name., My name "Harsha" actually means "who spreads happiness".., but  
this tendecy of forgetting things is making me constantly thinking about 
may be I did something wrong. When you constantly thinking about 
something bad is going to happen actually won't make you a happy person. 

I think that's the fun fact about me.., So I am the person who wants 
spread happiness around but in reality not.., may be I told you a sad 
fact. 

But anyway it is a fact.., It will change its face by which 
which side you are looking at it.., 

just being is fun for me..,  

What do you think...?
